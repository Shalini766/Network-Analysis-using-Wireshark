# Analysing Wifi Network with Wireshark
## Objective 
This project mainly focuses on analysing the web traffic on a Wi-Fi network using Wireshark, to detect if there is any communication with malicious websites, dropped packets, TCP, and UDP connections. Analysis of web traffic gives us the crucial understanding of web communication, detects potential threats and anomalies in network traffic.
### Skills Learned
- Understanding of network traffic.
- How two devices communicate through the network.
- Analysis of traffic through IP addresses and protocols.
- Capturing and filtering of packets.
- Detecting potential threats in the network and troubleshooting them.
### Tools Used
- Wireshark installed on your computer.
- Web browser to generate the traffic.
### Steps
#### Step 1:
Download and install Wireshark on Windows OS.
### Step 2 :
Select the wifi interface to capture the packets.
### Step 3:
Go to the capture tab and select start to capture the web traffic.
### Step 4:
To generate more traffic, open a browser and browse some of the topics, and visit any HTTP websites.
### Step 5:
Now click the stop button and start analysing the captured traffic, which contains TCP, UDP, HTTP, ARP, ICMP protocols.
### Step 6:
To filter the packets such as to view only HTTP, go to the filter tab and type HTTP then enter. Now you are able to see only HTTP traffic.
